Example code for step 5 for passing build (red phase)

```c#
public class Project
{
    public IList<Segment> Segments = new List<Segment>();
    private Segment _activeSegment;
    
    //Other code removed for readability...

    public int NumberOfTeamMembers{ get; set; }

    public void AddTeamMember(string member)
    {
    
    }
}
```
