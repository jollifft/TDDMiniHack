# TDDMiniHack
A quick and dirty intro into the wild and wonderful world of test driven development.  

__If you would like to do this mini-hack, please either fork this example to your own repo, or just download the zip of this. This will keep the master branch clean and unaltered and allow others in the furture to try this mini-hack too!__ :wink:

##Intro  
####The Basics
In short, Test Driven Development drives the design of your application. Your tests should be written **before** your code, and the code should implement the design of your tests. For those that are not familiar with TDD, this can be a weird feeling at first.  

The key differences between Unit Testing and Test Driven Development is:  
* Tests are written after the code in **Unit Testing**  
* Tests are written before the code in **TDD**  

*This can be a little bit confusing as __Unit Testing__ includes unit tests, but these are two different things.*

Some basic guidelines for TDD are:
* no code until you have a failing test
* tests should only test one thing
* just enough test code to test that one thing
* only enough application code to pass the test
* generally, only one assert per test

####Principles of Testing
The main principle to remember with TDD is __FIRST__:
* __FAST__: Tests should be fast. The faster they are, the more you will run them.
* __ISOLATED__: Tests should be independent of each other. They should be able to run in any order.
* __REPEATABLE__: You should get the same result for every N times you run your test.
* __SELF-VERIFYING__: Tests should be unambiguous. No human interaction should be required.
* __TIMELY__: Tests should be written before your code (or at the same time with __Unit Testing__).

You can find more information around FIRST here: https://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-01/unit-tests-are-first 

The second main principle to remember with TDD is __Red -> Green -> Refactor__.
* __Red__: Each test you write should start out failing.
* __Green__: Just enough application code is added for test to pass.
* __Refactor__: Clean up code to optimize and make project more readable

####Enough talk, lets code already!
In our example, we will be creating an application that tracks "projects", and the duration of a project. The basic starting point for the application is include here, and the steps to follow are posted below.  

##Steps
0) This example uses Nunit for testing. In Visual studio, if you have Resharper installed, you can use the built in Resharper testing tools to run the tests. If you do not have Resharper installed, you can install the Nunit test adapter.  
Right click the test project -> manage nuget packages -> search "nunit" -> NUnitTestAdapter -> Install  

1) Our first step will be to set up a "Must Pass" test. This is mainly just a sanity check to make sure we are starting out on the right foot with testing. In the test project, lets add our first test...
```c#
[Test]
public void MustPass()
{
    //Arrange
    int a = 1;
    int b = 1;
    //Act

    //Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(a, b);
}
```

2) Now that we know our test project is working, we can actually get into the meat of our application. Lets start by creating a test to make sure new projects are active when they are first created. However, we won't start by creating a project class. We will start with a test to make sure a project is active when it is created.
```c#
[Test]
public void WhenProjectStartedIsActive()
{
    //Arrange
    Project project = new Project();
    DateTime startTime = DateTime.Now;
    //Act
    project.Start(startTime);
    //Assert
    Assert.IsTrue(project.IsActive);
}
```
With our new test created, we now need to create just enough of the project class to get everything to build. We are not trying to get a passing test here, just enough to build successfully. 
Remember, we want our test to lead to the design of our application. Based on our test, we know we need to: 

* Create a project object
* Create a start method  
* Create an IsActive property  

Lets go ahead and create our project class now.
```c#
namespace TDDMiniHack
{
    public class Project
    {
        public bool IsActive { get; set; }

        public void Start(DateTime startTime)
        {
            
        }
    }
}
```
*Don't forget to add a reference from our main project to the test project so our tests know about our new project class*

Now that our application will build, lets go ahead and run all of our tests. Our new test should fail; THIS IS GOOD! This is the "Red" phase.  
Our next step is to get our test to pass, or the "Green" phase. From the test we have written, we know we are checking to see if our project is active. Knowing this, lets update our project class so our test will pass:

```c#
namespace TDDMiniHack
{
    public class Project
    {
        public bool IsActive { get; set; }

        public void Start(DateTime startTime)
        {
            IsActive = true;
        }
    }
}
```

Now lets go back and run all of our tests again. If you have set everything up correctly, all of our tests should now be passing! Great job, we are now in the "Green" phase.  
Our next phase would be to refactor. However, since this is still a fairly simple example, there is no refactoring needed. If there is any code you would like to clean up though, now is the time! 

3) Lets go ahead and create a new test. We want to be able to check the duration of our projects. Again, we won't start in the project class. We want start in our test project like last time.
```c#
[Test]
public void ProjectHasDuration()
{
    //Arrange
    Project project = new Project();
    DateTime startTime = DateTime.Now;

    //Act
    project.Start(startTime);
    project.End(startTime.AddSeconds(60));

    //Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(60, project.Duration);
}
```
Now that we have our test, we should be seeing some errors. Lets fix our build errors by implementing our missing logic. Keep in mind we only want to add enough code to get rid of our build errors. 

Our project class should now look like this:
```c#
public class Project
{
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }
    public double Duration { get; }

    public void Start(DateTime startTime)
    {
        IsActive = true;
    }

    public void End(DateTime endTime)
    {
        
    }
}
```

Now that we have resolved our errors, it's time for the "Red" phase again. Go ahead and run all of our tests again. The test we wrote should now fail. Again, this is good. Based off our our test method and how we have our project class set up, it should be easy to see what logic we are missing and where to add it. Lets update our project class now:
```c#
 public class Project
{
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }
    public double Duration
    {
        get { return (_endTime - _startTime).TotalSeconds; }
    }
    private DateTime _startTime;
    private DateTime _endTime;

    public void Start(DateTime startTime)
    {
        IsActive = true;
        _startTime = startTime;
    }

    public void End(DateTime endTime)
    {
        _endTime = endTime;
    }
}
```

Now that we have updated our project class, lets go ahead and run all of our test. If done correctly, all of our tests should now be passing! Our project is still fairly simple, so there isn't much room for refactoring. Refactor as you see fit.

4) Let's finish up with one final test. In this test, we want to make sure we can start and stop a project multiple times and that the duration works correctly.  
As before, we will start by creating our test:
```c#
[Test]
public void ProjectCanStartAndStopAndHasDuration()
{
    //Arrange
    Project project = new Project();
    DateTime startTime = DateTime.Now;

    //Act

    //one minute
    project.Start(startTime);
    project.End(startTime.AddSeconds(60));
    //two minutes
    project.Start(startTime.AddSeconds(120));
    project.End(startTime.AddSeconds(240));
    //three minutes
    project.Start(startTime.AddSeconds(300));
    project.End(startTime.AddSeconds(660));

    //Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(60+120+360, project.Duration);
}
```
Lets go ahead and run our new test. As you can see, our test will fail, putting us in the "Red" phase. Our test is failing because our Duration property is being reset each time. Lets update our code to take care of this.   

We'll start by creating a new class named "Segment". Our project class will keep a list of different project segments. Our Segment class will look like this:
```c#
public class Segment
{
    public DateTime StartTime { get; set; }
    public DateTime EndTime { get; set; }

    public void Start(DateTime startTime)
    {
        StartTime = startTime;
    }

    public void End(DateTime endTime)
    {
        EndTime = endTime;
    }
}
```
Now we have a way to keep track of the start and end times of different segments for each project. With that done, lets update our "Project" class to use our new segments. 
```c#
public class Project
{
    public IList<Segment> Segments = new List<Segment>();
    private Segment _activeSegment;

    public bool IsActive { get; set; }
    public double Duration
    {
        get
        {
            double totalDuration = 0;
            foreach (var segment in Segments)
            {
                totalDuration += (segment.EndTime - segment.StartTime).TotalSeconds;
            }
            return totalDuration;
        }
    }
    

    public void Start(DateTime startTime)
    {
        _activeSegment = new Segment();
        _activeSegment.Start(startTime);

        IsActive = true;
    }

    public void End(DateTime endTime)
    {
        _activeSegment.End(endTime);
        Segments.Add(_activeSegment);
    }
}
```
Our "Project" class now lets the "Segment" class handle keeping track of the start and end times. Our "Project" class now keeps track of the active segment, starting a new one each time the project is started, and ending and adding the segment to a list each time the project is ended. Also, notice that we have updated our getter for the duration property to correctly add up the total duration of each segment.  

Go ahead and run all of our tests again. If done correctly, all of our tests should now be passing, putting us back at the "Green" phase! Again, now is the time you should refactor as you see fit. 

####On your own

5) Now that you have a better understanding of TDD, lets try creating a few more tests on your own. In this one, we want to test that we can add team members to a project, and that we can get the total number of team members after they have been added.

As before, we will start by creating our test method. It should include the following:
* A name that is meaningful to what we are testing (i.e. CanAddTeamMembersToProject...)
* Adds some team members to a project
* Asserts that the correct number of team members are included in the project  

If you need a little help setting this up, you can find an example [here](../master/Hints/Step_5_Test.md)

Next, we need to update our code just enough to get it to build (this is the red phase). Once it builds, go ahead and run your test to make sure we are in the red phase. Again, if you need some help, you can see an example [here](../master/Hints/Step_5_Red.md)

Finally, lets go ahead and update our code to correctly add and return the correct number of team members. Once you have everything set up, go ahead and run your test. We should now be in the green phase. Go ahead and refactor anything you think could use some love. You can find an example of the completed code [here](../master/Hints/Step_5_Green.md)

##Conclusion
Congrats! You have now started down the path to becoming a great Test Driven Developer. Some of the key take-aways from this should be:
* Tests first, code second
* Only enough code to complete the test at hand
* Red -> Green -> Refactor
* FIRST principle
